This is my code and recorded data from tracking a Cepheid Variable star as means to estimate luminal periodicity and distance.

The data was collected overnight at Trottier Observatory located at Simon Fraser University.

Unfortunately, the technical document summarizing the results has been lost to access, however, I managed to salvage the important graphs and the code.
