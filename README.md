This is my code and recorded data from tracking a Cepheid Variable star as means to estimate luminal periodicity and distance.

The data was collected overnight at Trottier Observatory located at Simon Fraser University.

Unfortunately, I have lost access to the technical document that summarizes the results, however I managed to salvage the important graphs and the code.
